        <h2>The Canon EOS R6</h2>
        <h4>October 2, 2024 by Nathan Crossdale </h4>
        <img class="blog-two-image" src="r6.jpg" alt="image of Camera">
        <p>The Canon EOS R6 is a highly capable mirrorless camera that appeals to both photographers and videographers. 
        It features a 20.1 MP full-frame CMOS sensor, which delivers impressive image quality, especially in low-light conditions. 
        For videographers, the R6 supports 4K video recording at up to 60 frames per second and 1080p at 120 fps for smooth slow-motion shots. 
        The in-body image stabilization (IBIS) offers up to 8 stops of stabilization when paired with RF lenses, making handheld shooting more stable.
         Its Dual Pixel CMOS AF II autofocus system is incredibly fast and accurate, with excellent subject tracking for eyes, faces, and animals. 
         The camera also performs well in low light, with an ISO range of 100-102,400, expandable up to 204,800. It includes dual UHS-II SD card slots 
         for flexible storage options and can shoot at 12 fps with the mechanical shutter or 20 fps with the electronic shutter, perfect for capturing fast action. 
         Overall, the R6 provides a great balance of performance for both still and video work.

        <h2>Best Photo Shoot ever !!! </h2>
        <h4>October 2, 2024 by Nathan Crossdale</h4>
        <img class="blog-two-image" src="wedding.jpg" alt="image of wedding">
        <p> The wedding photoshoot was one of the best I've ever done. 
            Everything about the day was beautiful, from the stunning venue to the perfect lighting. 
            The couple was incredibly cool and easygoing, which made the shoot even more enjoyable. 
            Their chemistry was effortless, and it was a pleasure capturing those genuine, intimate moments between them. 
            Every detail, from the decorations to the outfits, added to the charm of the day, and it all came together to create some of the most memorable shots I've taken. 
            It was a truly unforgettable experience, and I'm excited about how the final photos turned out.
